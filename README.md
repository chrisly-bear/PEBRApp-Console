# PEBRApp Console

This is an administrative tool to help manage the PEBRApp users and data (see [PEBRApp repository](https://github.com/chrisly-bear/PEBRApp)). It is designed for desktop, but there's also a mobile variant on the `mobile` branch.

## Building and Running

If you're getting a build error when running on macOS, run `pod install` from the `macos/` directory.

See [flutter-desktop-embedding README](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/blob/master/README.md) and [Flutter Wiki](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells) for more details.
